### Olaris Rename

A simple tool to automatically rename files based on their information.

If you want something more powerfull please check out [Filebot](https://www.filebot.net/)

To start scanning give it a `--filepath` argument, this can be a folder or file.

By default it will rename files based purely on the given filenames, alternatively
you can set `--tmdb-lookup=true`. In this case it will try to look-up actual titles
found in the filename on themoviedb.org, this might result in better names but will
be much slower.
